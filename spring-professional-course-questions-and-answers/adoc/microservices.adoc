== Microservices


What is a microservices architecture?::

Microservice architecture is a method of developing software applications as a suite of *independently deployable*, *small*, *modular* services in which each service runs a unique process and *communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism* to serve a business goal.


What are the advantages and disadvantages of microservices?::

- Harder to build
- Network overhead
+ Better maintainability and extensibility
+ Scaling out easier


What sub-projects of Spring Cloud did we cover in the course? Spring Cloud is a large umbrella project â€“ only what we covered in the course will be tested.::

* Spring Cloud Netflix (Service Discovery, Load Balancing)
* Spring Cloud Config (Dynamic Reconfiguration)
* Spring Cloud Connectors (Iaas Integration)
* Spring Cloud Security (Utility)
* Spring Cloud CLI (Utility)
* Spring Cloud Data Flow (Data Integration)


Would you recognize the Spring Cloud annotations and configuration we used in the course if you saw it in the exam?::

* `@EnableEurekaServer`: Eureka service registry.
* `@EnableDiscoveryClient`: Service implementation.
* `@LoadBalanced`: On a rest template to inject a smart, load-balanced template.


What Netflix projects did we use?::

* Eureka (Service Discovery)
* Ribbon (Load-Balancer)


What is Service Discovery? How is this related to Eureka?::

Service Discovery describes the dynamic lookup of service consumers at a common registry.
Eureka itself is a service registry, implemented by Netflix.


How do you setup Service Discovery?::

Using the `@EnableDiscoveryClient` annotation and a service discovery configuration e.g.,

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
	application:
		name: accounts-microservice
eureka:
	client:
 		serviceUrl:
			defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
----


How do you access a RESTful microservice?::

`@EnableDiscoveryClient` injects a smart rest template that accessed the relevant service through a URL.
