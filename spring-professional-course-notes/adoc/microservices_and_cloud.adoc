== Microservices and Cloud embeded Systems

[.lead]
Building Cloud Native Applications.


=== What are Microservices?

Three Tier Architecture::
* Single “monolithic” application that does everything.
* Single, large development team.
* Separate Ops, DBAs, Dev teams.
* All data in single relational database.

//^

Microservice Features::
* Multi-Language
** Not all the services need to be in the same language / framework
* Polyglot Persistence
** Each service uses the most suitable storage system.
* Stand-alone Development
** Develop, Test and Deploy each service independently.
** Separate teams, leverage Dev Ops.

.Trade-Offs.
|=======
|Single App|Microservices
|Easier to build |Harder to build
|Large process to deploy |Network Overheads
|Ultimately more complex to enhance and maintain|Ultimately simpler to enhance and maintain
|Scaling Up (bigger processors) limited|Scaling Out (more processes) easier
|=======

Core Spring Architectural Concepts::
* Spring emphasizes
** Loose Coupling
*** Applications are built from collaborating services (processes).
*** Similar to Service Oriented Architectures (SOA).
** Tight Cohesion
*** An application (service) that deals with a single view of data.
*** Also known as “Bounded Contexts” (Domain-Driven Design).

//^

Why Cloud, Why PaaS (Platform as a Service)?::
* Deploying multiple processes is complicated.
** Security, resilience, redundancy, load-balancing.
* A Cloud (PaaS) provides the necessary tools.
** Natural fit for deploying a microservice-based system.
** Application is the unit of deployment.
** Application instances are the unit of scaling.
** Start, stop and restart apps independently, on-demand.
** Provide dynamic load-balancing, scaling and routing.



Cloud Native Applications::
* Applications
** Designed to run “in the cloud”.
** In isolated, disposable containers.
*** Fast to scale-up and scale-down.
* Make no assumptions about the underlying infrastructure.
** Local file-system transient.
** Sessions lost on restart.
* Should design applications to suit this environment.
**  Use http://12factor.net[Twelve Factor Application design patterns].

//^

Why Spring Boot?::
* Faster to develop than traditional Spring.
* Java apps become as easy as Grails or Rails apps.
** But with JVM robustness and scalability.
* Easy to incorporate other Spring modules.
** As listed on previous slide.
* Spring Cloud requires Spring Boot.

=== Challenges and Implementation

Create a new Microservice App::
* Start with Monolith
* As it grows:
** Decompose into micro-service(s).
** Enables separately manageable and deployable units.
** Each can use own storage solution (polyglot persistence).

//^

Decompose an existing Monolith::
* Develop new functionality as microservice(s) around existing single-process application.
* Refactor existing monolith functionality into new microservice(s).
** Refactor at service layer.
** Monolith service communicates over an agreed protocol e.g., HTML with the new microservice.


=== Spring Cloud

==== Overview

* Building blocks for Cloud and Microservice applications.
** Microservices Infrastructure.
*** Wraps up and makes available useful services.
*** Several based on other Open Source projects e.g., Netfix, HashiCorp's Consul
** Cloud Independence.
*** Access cloud-specific information and services.
*** Support for Cloud Foundry, AWS and Heroku.
*** Or run without any cloud at all.
* Uses Spring Boot starters.
** Requires Spring Boot to work.

//^

Spring Cloud Projects::
* IaaS Integration
* Dynamic Reconfiguration
* Service Discovery / Load Balancing
* Utilities
* Data Ingestion

//^

Communication between Microservices::
* Rest / JSON typically used.
** How do Services find each other?
** What happens if we run mutliple instances?

//^

Registry Servers for Microservices::
* Two popular open-source registry services.
** Eureka (Netflix)
** Consul.io (Vagrant)
* Spring cloud makes it easy to use either of or switch between them.

Building a Microservice System::
. Run a Discovery Service.
. Run a Microservice.
** Ensure it registers itself with the Discovery Service.
. How do Microservice clients find the service?
** Inject a “smart” RestTemplate.
*** Spring performs service lookup for you.
*** Uses logical service names in URLs.

==== Eureka Service Discovery

[source,java]
.Eureka application class.
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaServer
public class EurekaApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EurekaApplication.class, args);
	}
}
----

[source,yaml]
.Eureka configuration.
----
server:
	port : 8761
eureka:
	instance:
		hostname: localhost
	client:  # Not a client
  		registerWithEureka: false
	  	fetchRegistry: false
----


==== Service Registration

* Each microservice declares itself a discovery-client.
** Using `@EnableDiscoveryClient`.
** Registers using its application name.

[source,java]
.Service implementation.
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
public class AccountsApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}
}
----

[source,java]
.Service discovery configuration.
----
spring:
	application:
		name: accounts-microservice //<1>
eureka:
	client:
 		serviceUrl:
			defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/ //<2>
----
<1> Service name.
<2> Eureka server URL.


==== Service Discovery Client

[source,java]
.Discovery client with a smart Rest-Template.
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
public class FrontEndApplication {
    
	public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}

	@Bean
	public AccountManager accountManager() {
    	return new RemoteAccountManager();
	}
}

@Service
public class RemoteAccountManager {

	// Spring injects a “smart” service-aware template
	// configured with RibbonHttpRequestClient to do a
	// load-balanced lookup
	@Autowired
	@LoadBalanced
	RestTemplate restTemplate;

	public Account findAccount(String id) {
		// Fetch data
		return restTemplate.getForObject(
				"http://accounts-microservice/accounts/{id}", // service name
				Account.class, 
				id);
	}
}
----

Intelligent Routing::
* Spring Cloud automatically integrates two Netflix utilities.
** “Eureka” service-discovery.
** “Ribbon” load-balancer.
* End result
** Determines the best available service to use (when there are multiple instances of a microservice).
** Just inject the load-balanced RestTemplate.
** Automatic lookup by logical service-name.
