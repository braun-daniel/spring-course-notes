== Transactions

[.lead]
Transactional proxies and @Transactional.

=== Why use Transactions?

A set of tasks which take place as a single, indivisible action. It follows the *ACID* principles.

Atomic:: Each unit of work is an all-or-nothing operation.
Consistent:: Database integrity constraints are never violated.
Isolated:: Isolating transactions from each other.
Durable:: Committed changes are permanent.

=== Java Transaction Management 

Java has several APIs which *handle transactions differently*: JDBC, JMS, JTA, Hibernate, JPA, etc. Each uses *program code to mark the start and end of the transaction* (Transaction Demarcation) where there are different APIs for *Global vs Local transactions*.

Local Transactions:: 
Transactions managed by underlying resource. +
App => Database
Global (distributed) Transactions:: 
Transaction managed by separate, dedicated transaction manager. +
App => TRX manager => PSQL, RabbitMQ, ...


==== Drawbacks

* Multiple APIs for different local resources 
* Programatic transaction demarcation
** Typically performed in the repository layer (wrong place) 
** Usually repeated (cross-cutting concern)
* Service layer more appropriate
** Multiple data access methods often called within a single transaction
** But: don't want data-access code in service-layer Orthogonal concerns
* Transaction demarcation should be independent of transaction implementation

[source,java]
.Transactions which are already in progress cannot be joined and code cannot be used with global transactions.
----
 try {
	conn = dataSource.getConnection(); // <1>
	conn.setAutoCommit(false); // <2>
	...
	conn.commit(); // <2>
} catch (Exception e) { // <3>
	conn.rollback();
	...
}
----
<1> Specific to JDBC API.
<2> Programatic trx demarcation.
<3> Checked exceptions.


=== Spring Transaction Management 

* Spring separates transaction demarcation from transaction implementation
** Demarcation expressed declaratively via AOP
*** Programatic approach also available
** PlatformTransactionManager abstraction hides implementation details.
*** Several implementations available
* Spring uses the same API for global vs. local.
** Change from local to global is minor 
*** Just change the transaction manager

There are 2 steps: declare a `PlatformTransactionManager` bean and the transactional methods (annotationm, XML or programatic).


==== PlatformTransactionManager

Springâ€™s `PlatformTransactionManager` is the base interface for the abstraction. Several implementations are available e.g., DataSourceTransactionManager, HibernateTransactionManager and more.

[source,java]
.Manager for a datasource.
----
@Bean
public PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager(DataSource dataSource) {
	return new DataSourceTransactionManager(dataSource); 
}
----

[source,java]
.In the code.
----
public class RewardNetworkImpl implements RewardNetwork {

	@Transactional
	public RewardConfirmation rewardAccountFor(Dining d) {
		// atomic unit-of-work
	}
}
----

[source,java]
.In the configuration.
----
@Configuration
@EnableTransactionManagement // <1>
public class TxnConfig {
	
	@Bean
	public PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager(DataSource ds){
		return new DataSourceTransactionManager(ds);
	}
----
<1> Defines a Bean Post-Processor.

What happens::
. Target object wrapped in a proxy (Around advice)
. Proxy implements the following behavior
.. Transaction started before entering the method
.. Commit at the end of the method
.. Rollback if method throws a RuntimeException (default, can be overridden)
. Transaction context bound to current thread. 
. All controlled by configuration


==== @Transactional

On class the @Transactional applies to all methods declared in the interface(s). You can also declare it on both, class- and method- level but with different settings e.g., timeouts.


=== Isolation Levels

There are 4 isolation levels where some DBMS may not support all levels.

[source,java]
----
@Transactional (isolation=Isolation.XXX)
----

READ_UNCOMMITTED::
* Lowest level - allows dirty reads
* Current transaction can see the results of another uncommitted unit-of-work
* Typically used for large, intrusive read-only transactions 
* And/or where the data is constantly changing

READ_COMMITTED::
* Does not allow dirty reads (only committed information can be accessed)
* Default strategy for most databases

REPEATABLE_READ::
* Does not allow dirty reads
* Non-repeatable reads are prevented
** If a row is read twice in the same transaction, result will always be the same
** Might result in locking depending on the DBMS

SERIALIZABLE::
* Prevents non-repeatable reads and dirty-reads
* Also prevents phantom reads


=== Transaction Propagation

Transaction propagation is calling a `@Transactional` method within another `@Transactional` method. There are *7 levels of propagation*. Two will be presented here.

[source,java]
----
@Transactional( propagation=Propagation.XXX )
----

REQUIRED::
Default. Execute within a current transaction, create a new one if none existing.

REQUIRES_NEW::
Create a new transaction, suspending the current transaction of one exists.

MANDATORY::
Throw exception if none exists; otherwise use current transaction.

NEVER::
Don't create a transaction if none exists. Throw exception if one existing.

NOT_SUPPORTED::
Don't create a transaction if none exists. Suspend transaction, if one exists, then run method outside of a transaction.

SUPPORTS::
Don't create a transaction if none exists; otherwise use existing transaction.


=== Rollback rules

By default, a transaction is rolled back if a RuntimeException has been thrown. Default settings can be overridden with `rollbackFor` and `noRollbackFor` attributes.

[source,java]
----
@Transactional(rollbackFor=MyCheckedException.class, noRollbackFor={JmxException.class, MailException.class})
----

=== Testing

Annotate test method (or class) with `@Transactional`. This runs the test method in a transaction and *rolls back afterwards*. Using the `@Commit` annotation, the transaction won't be rolled back. Test methods with `@BeforeTransaction` get executed before the transaction is created.
